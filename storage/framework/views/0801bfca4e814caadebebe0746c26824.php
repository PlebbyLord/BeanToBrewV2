                    <h2>Notices</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may give notice to you of a change in this Agreement and any other matter through a general posting on the Bean to Brew Coffee Production, or other means determined by the Company.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement and the Privacy Policy referred to herein represent your entire agreement with Bean to Brew Coffee Production regarding the use of the service and the Site. 
                        You agree that this Agreement is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Bean to Brew Coffee Production. 
                        If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect 
                        the original intention of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to insist upon 
                        strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws 
                        of the Province of Bataan without regard to its conflict of rules. You expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with Bean to Brew Coffee Production 
                        or relating in any way to your use of the service or the Site resides in the province courts of Bataan and you further expressly consent and agree to personal 
                        jurisdiction by the state and federal courts sitting in the Province of Bataan in connection with any such dispute, including any claim involving Bean to Brew Coffee Production. 
                        Any cause of action by you must be instituted within one year after the claim or cause of action has arisen, or be barred.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future Amendments</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bean to Brew may amend this Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on our Site. 
                        All amended terms shall automatically be effective at the time they are initially posted on our Site. 
                        By accessing this Site after the effective date of any such amendment, you agree to be bound by any such revisions 
                        and should therefore periodically visit this page to determine the then current Agreement to which you are bound. 
                        In all cases, as a condition of making deliveries to you, you agree to review this Agreement from time to time.
